# Budget Tracker â€“ COMP348 Assignment 1

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **Budget Tracking System** written in C for the COMP348: Principles of Programming Languages course.  
The program allows users to track income and expenses, sort and filter transactions, and view expense distributions.  
It is designed to give hands-on experience with **C programming fundamentals** such as:
- File I/O
- Structs
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Modular programming
- Pointers and arrays
- Error checking

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The codebase is divided into multiple files for modularity:
main.c # Contains main function and menu logic
budget.c # Implements budget-related operations (add, modify, distribution, etc.)
data.c # Handles file reading, parsing, and data management
ordering.c # Sorting functionality
main.h, budget.h, data.h, ordering.h # Corresponding header files
